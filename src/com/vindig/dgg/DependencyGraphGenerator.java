/**
 * V0.1
 * Dependency Graph Generator (hence-on referred as 'DGG') is an application to create a visual graphic detailing
 * the relationship between files in a project structure (initially C/C++).
 * The initial project goals are to generate a readable image file detailing what files are imported by other files, displaying these relationships
 * in a hierarchical schema.
 * 
 * Continued work on the project will seek to provide:
 *  further depth explanation of the dependencies,
 *   highlighting object inheritance,
 *    function/method calls,
 *     custom configurations
 *  gui for standalone application
 *  	-- or browser based app
 *  with export options of pdf, web project, image file, or a custom file
